# Non-Monetary Donation Application for NGOs

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a non-monetary donation application for NGOs (non-government organizations) to facilitate communication between donors and individuals/organizations in need. The application will enable donors to offer various items such as clothes, medical supplies, school supplies, furniture, toys, etc., to those in need. The project consists of two milestones:

- **Milestone 1**: Requirements engineering for both web and mobile applications.
- **Milestone 2**: Front-end design and development for the web application.

## Case Description
The following case description outlines the functionality of the web/mobile application from a donor's perspective:

1. **Browse and Select Cases**: Donors can browse through different cases listed on the application, including the needs and urgency of each case (e.g., ages, sizes, etc.).
   
2. **Send Donation Requests**: Donors can select a case matching the items they want to donate and send a request to donate those items.

3. **Donate to Organizations**: Donors can also donate items to organizations (including Mosques and Churches) that will distribute them to those in need. They can locate organizations accepting donations and send requests accordingly.

4. **Delivery Arrangements**: Once the donation request is accepted, donors are informed that a delivery person will pick up the donated items.

5. **Track Donations**: Donors can track their donations until they are delivered to the intended recipients.
